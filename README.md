# workbot
bot for my part-time job
i sometimes work in a warehouse, they always put work-shifts on this website for limited number of people that they need for that day.
for example for friday they need 3 people, so only 3 people can take that shift. And because i don't want to check the website all the time i made a bot that monitor the website and send me an email if the shift that i want is there
